# cs210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project reads a file and creates a menu where user can retrieve specific items and it's frequency, display all items , and create a file with all items and their frequency.

What did you do particularly well?
I used efficient functions that was reused in multiple area of the project.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The validating functions might be acheived through lesser codes.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Integrating python and C++ was the most challenging. I overcame this by looking at the error messages shown in the terminal and asjusting my code accordingly. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The user input validation functions should be quite similar in other programs that requires user inputs.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I started with the python functions first which dealt with data, and then I focused on the menu item in C++ , and at the end I integrated two together.
